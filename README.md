# FizzBuzz

A FizzBuzz implementation in PHP, implemented through TDD.

Most FizzBuzz examples:-

 - lack unit tests
 - lack the ability to change the settings for Fizz and Buzz
 - are unclear in their implementation (i.e. if it was more complicated than FizzBuzz it would be hard to follow the logic)
 - do not separate the concerns appropriately - the same function or class should not be responsible for dealing with looping over the range AND making the decision on whether to Fizz, Buzz or Fizzbuzz.
